### Cryptographic hash functions for reference
I've been building some Hash function implementations - just to learn the stuff.

Not putting this out there for others to use. **It's in no way close to production ready.**
Rather, I figured I'd put this out as a reference, for other people that are implementing their first hash functions.
I know I wish I had more code examples to look at.

The official reference implementations were pretty tough to understand to me.
I guess I just found the code style very foreign. And I sort of wished I had more ***other*** examples to look at myself.
